# Module Starter
This is a VERY basic starter template for building reusable modules.

## Getting started
- Change `output.libarary` name in `webpack.config.js`
- Change name in package.json
- Change name is bower.json
- `$ rm -r .git`
- `$ git init` and setup new repo
- `$ npm i`

## Usage
- `$ npm start` to run webpack-dev-server
- `$ npm test` to run unit tests
- `$ npm tdd` to continuously run tests
- `$ npm run jshint` to lint code
- `$ npm run build` to build (and minify)
- `$ npm version (patch|minor|major)` to create git release
